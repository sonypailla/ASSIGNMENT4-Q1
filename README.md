## Description:
This project demonstrates a simple NLP preprocessing pipeline in Python using the NLTK library. The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Tokenization** - Splits a sentence into individual words and punctuation.
2. **Stopword Removal** - Removes common English stopwords like "the", "in", "are".
3. **Stemming** - Reduces words to their root forms using the Porter Stemmer.

## Sample Input Sentence:
```text
"NLP techniques are used in virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri."
